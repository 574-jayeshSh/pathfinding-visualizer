# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

Hi! I'm Jayesh Sharma, and this is my **Pathfinding Visualizer** — a React + Tailwind CSS-based interactive tool that demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms work in real-time on a grid.

## 🎯 Features

- **Interactive Grid** – Create walls and weighted nodes by clicking or Shift+Clicking.
- **Visualize Algorithms**:
  - 🟦 **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Weighted, always finds the shortest path)
  - 🟩 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** (Unweighted, shortest path)
  - 🟨 **Depth-First Search (DFS)** (Unweighted, not optimal)
  - 🟥 **A\*** (Coming Soon – Heuristic-based and smart)

- **Reset Grid** – Clear walls, weights, and paths with one click.
- **Adjust Speed** – Toggle between normal and fast visualization speeds.
- **Responsive UI** – Works well on desktop and adapts to different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – For dynamic UI and component management
- **Tailwind CSS** – For fast, clean, and responsive styling
- **TypeScript** – For better code structure and type safety (if you’ve used it)
- **Custom Hooks** – For grid logic and pathfinding animation
